        <h3>Description</h3>

        </form>

        <p>Allow this page to access your microphone, then <b>click the mic to start recording</b>. Once you're done, <b>click the mic again to stop recording</b>. The audio output will be saved as a WAV file and uploaded to the file upload question on this page through an AJAX request to our file upload API. (In a live survey, the file upload question would be hidden.)</p><br>
